## Why a peacock

A peacock is a lovely bird. But it is sometimes difficult to find it in our neighbourhoods. So what do we do?

You might think, why not just watch one on your laptop or your smart phone.

While that is a very good idea, what if I tell you that using new front-end technologies, you can create your own peacock? Are you ready to dive deep with me into how to create a peacock?

## Making a peacock

So you want me to see how we go create a peacock for ourselves.

Here is the simplest way of creating a peacock.

```javascript{numberLines: true}
// highlight-start
const peacock = new Peacock({
  name: "Tweety Peacocka",
  color: "Rainbow color",
  features: ["talks to you", "loves you so much", "plays with you"],
})
// highlight-end

// now make it fly

peacock.fly()
```

There you go, see? So simple. Now go create a peacock for yourself.

Tell me how it went on my twitter account.
