## Why a parrot

A parrot is a lovely bird. But it is sometimes difficult to find it in our neighbourhoods. So what do we do?

You might think, why not just watch one on your laptop or your smart phone.

While that is a very good idea, what if I tell you that using new front-end technologies, you can create your own parrot? Are you ready to dive deep with me into how to create a parrot?

## Making a parrot

So you want me to see how we go create a parrot for ourselves.

Here is the simplest way of creating a parrot.

```javascript{numberLines: true}
// highlight-start
const parrot = new Parrot({
  name: "Tweety Parrota",
  color: "Rainbow color",
  features: ["talks to you", "loves you so much", "plays with you"],
})
// highlight-end

// now make it fly

parrot.fly()
```

There you go, see? So simple. Now go create a parrot for yourself.

Tell me how it went on my twitter account.
