> These are some of the points related to best practices for reusable components in React-based projects.

- Components should be small and easy to read.
- Use prop-types package to structure and validate the props of your components.
- For styled-components, do not include any functional details, instead pass them as props.
- For container components, do not include UI details, instead, let the children styled-components take care of them
- Prefer functional components vs class-based components.
- Prefer CSS in JS strategy for styled-components for better maintainability.
- UI variations should be coming in as configurable props whereas data should be coming up as part of a global state like Redux or React Context.
- Donâ€™t repeat sections wherever it can be avoided, instead use arrays to store those section details and loop over them.
- For components, add comments only wherever absolutely necessary (to indicate a hack or workaround for a bug).
- For library utilities (pure functions), write JS-Doc comments.
- Avoid using anonymous components wherever possible.
- All files for a component should be part of the same folder.
- Always use eslint and prettier for keeping your code clean and formatted.
- Use ES6 features.
